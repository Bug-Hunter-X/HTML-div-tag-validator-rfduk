This repository contains an example of an unclosed div tag in an HTML file.  The bug causes rendering issues in some browsers, and the solution demonstrates how to fix it by properly closing all HTML tags.

The `bug.html` file shows the original code with the error.  The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected code with the unclosed tag fixed.
